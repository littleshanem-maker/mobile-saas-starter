## üéØ Philosophy

Both your web and mobile kits share the same core principles:

1. **Ship Fast** - Get to market in days, not months
2. **Start Lean** - Under $100/month infrastructure costs
3. **Scale Sustainably** - Profitable from first customer
4. **Stay Focused** - Pre-built features let you focus on differentiation
5. **Maintain Quality** - Production-ready code, not tutorials
6. **Use Modern Tech** - Latest frameworks and best practices
7. **Keep It Simple** - No unnecessary complexity

This mobile kit embodies all of these. It's opinionated, streamlined, and ready for production.

## ü§î Common Questions

### Q: Can I share code with the web version?
A: Yes! Database schema, types, and API logic are 90% identical. Deploy once, use twice.

### Q: Do I need to build for both platforms simultaneously?
A: No. Build web first, validate the market, then add mobile when ready. Same backend serves both.

### Q: What if I want to add native features later?
A: Very easy. Frameworks like Stripe Mobile SDKs, Push Notifications, and Biometric auth are already available.

### Q: How do I handle updates?
A: Expo provides multiple options: OTA updates for JavaScript, or full app rebuilds for native changes.

### Q: What about offline support?
A: Built-in! The kit includes AsyncStorage and Secure Store for caching data locally.

### Q: Is this suitable for high-traffic apps?
A: Yes. Supabase scales to millions of API calls. Start here, scale with confidence.
