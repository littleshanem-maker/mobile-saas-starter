# Web vs Mobile Micro-SaaS Starter Kits

A detailed comparison showing how both kits follow the **same philosophy** while being optimized for their respective platforms.

## 🎯 Shared Philosophy

Both kits are built on these core principles:

✅ **Rapid Deployment** - Ship in days, not weeks  
✅ **Low Costs** - Keep monthly burn under $200  
✅ **High Margins** - 90%+ profit potential  
✅ **Production Ready** - Pre-built auth, payments, dashboards  
✅ **Scalable** - Start indie, grow to teams  
✅ **Type-Safe** - Full TypeScript support  
✅ **Modern Stack** - Latest frameworks & tools

| Camera Access | ❌ | ✅ | Device-specific |
| File Storage | ❌ | ✅ | Use Supabase Storage for both if needed |

---

## Code Reuse Opportunities

### Backend Sharing (100% reuse)

```typescript
// Both kits use the same Supabase client library
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

// Same database schema
// Same RLS policies
// Same auth flows
// Same API endpoints
```

### Type Definitions (100% reuse)

```typescript
// types/user.ts - Used by both web and mobile
export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  full_name?: string;
  subscription_tier: 'free' | 'pro' | 'enterprise';
}
```

### API Clients (90% reuse)

```typescript
// lib/api.ts - Mostly same, with platform-specific tweaks
export const api = {
  auth: { /* same for both */ },
  subscriptions: { /* same for both */ },
  payments: { /* same Stripe handling */ },
}
```

### UI Components (0% direct reuse)

```
Web: React components with TailwindCSS
Mobile: React Native components with NativeWind

✗ Can't directly copy component files
✓ Can copy logic, styling approaches, and patterns
```

---

## Feature Roadmap Example

### Month 1 (MVP - Web Only)
- Setup Supabase
- Build landing page
- Auth (email)
- Subscription tier
- Basic dashboard
- Stripe integration

**Cost:** ~$100 (dev time + tools)

### Month 2 (Web Optimization)
- Improve onboarding
- Analytics
- Email notifications
- SEO optimization
- Support chat

**Cost:** ~$200 cumulative

### Month 3 (Mobile Launch)
- Build mobile app (shares backend)
- iOS/Android builds
- App store submission
- Mobile notifications

**Cost:** ~$400 cumulative (not much more!)

### Month 4+ (Scale)
- Add more features
- Analytics
- Content/billing improvements
- Both platforms grow

**Insight:** Mobile adds ~$100-150 development time but minimal infrastructure costs because of shared backend.

---

## When to Use Each Kit

### Use Web Kit Alone

✅ B2B SaaS (workflows happen on desktop)  
✅ Complex dashboards (more screen real estate)  
✅ Budget constraints (lower hosting costs)  
✅ Developer-focused tools  
✅ Content-heavy products  

**Example:** Project management tool, analytics platform, developer tools

### Use Mobile Kit Alone

✅ Location-based services  
✅ Real-time data (weather, stocks, chat)  
✅ Habit tracking / wellness apps  
✅ Social apps  
✅ On-the-go utilities  

**Example:** Habit tracker, location check-in app, real-time notification service

### Use BOTH (Recommended)

✅ Maximum reach (desktop + mobile users)  
✅ Shared backend = lower costs  
✅ Better monetization (more touchpoints)  
✅ User flexibility (switch between platforms)  
✅ Competitive advantage (native apps vs web)  

**Example:** Productivity app, social platform, fitness app, finance app

---

## Development Workflow Example

```
Scenario: Adding a "user preferences" feature
─────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Design Schema (Both platforms use same)
   CREATE TABLE user_preferences (...)

2. Update Types (Both platforms use same)
   export interface UserPreferences { ... }

3. Create API Helpers (Both platforms share most)
   lib/api.ts → export const updatePreferences()

4. Build Web UI (Web kit only)
   components/PreferencesForm.tsx

5. Build Mobile UI (Mobile kit only)
   components/PreferencesForm.tsx

6. Test Both
   npm run dev (web)
   expo start (mobile)

7. Deploy Both
   git push (Vercel auto-deploys)
   eas build → submit to stores

Result: Single feature across 2 platforms in one workflow
```

---

## Migration Path: Web → Web + Mobile

If you launch web first and want to add mobile later:

### Step 1: Extract Shared Code (1-2 hours)
```
Supabase types/schema (copy as-is)
API utilities (copy, adapt slightly)
Constants (copy as-is)
Auth logic (copy, wrap for mobile)
```

### Step 2: Build Mobile (1-2 weeks)
```
Setup Expo project
Connect to same Supabase
Build screens (new UI, same logic)
Test thoroughly
Submit to stores
```

### Step 3: Maintain Both (Ongoing)
```
Backend changes: Both platforms update immediately
Feature additions: Add to web/mobile as needed
Bug fixes: Usually require separate fixes
Deployment: Independent release cycles
```

**Total added development:** ~2-3 weeks (not starting from scratch)

---

## Key Takeaway

Both kits embody the **same lean SaaS philosophy**:

1. **Unified Backend** - Single database, auth, payments
2. **Modern Frameworks** - Next.js (web) & React Native (mobile)
3. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support
4. **Rapid Deployment** - Hours, not weeks
5. **Low Costs** - Shared infrastructure = cheaper
6. **High Margins** - Same unit economics both platforms
7. **Flexibility** - Start web, add mobile without rewrite

**The magic:** Your second platform (mobile) costs maybe 10-20% more in infrastructure but 50% less in development time because the backend is already built.
