## 🎯 Recommended Launch Path

### Path 1: Web First (Recommended)

**Phase 1: MVP (Week 1-3)**
- Launch web kit
- Basic features
- Stripe integration
- Collect early users

**Phase 2: Market Validation (Week 4-8)**
- Gather feedback
- Improve features
- Build user base
- Monitor metrics

**Phase 3: Mobile Expansion (Week 9-11)**
- Build mobile kit (shares backend!)
- Much faster because backend exists
- Launch on both app stores

**Result:** 11 weeks to web + mobile, same Supabase

### Path 2: Mobile First

**Pros:**
- Native experience
- Direct user interaction
- App store presence

**Cons:**
- Slower initial launch (app store review 1-5 days)
- Harder to iterate (app store resubmission required)
- Requires more upfront development time

**When to choose:** If your audience is mobile-native (location, social, real-time)

### Path 3: Both Simultaneously

**Pros:**
- Maximum reach from day 1
- Mobile + web users

**Cons:**
- More development time upfront
- Harder to manage two platforms
- More QA needed

**When to choose:** When you have a team, more time, and clear market demand
